Abstract 

Ireland's long history of emigration has changed over the past three decades, with the country 
currently experiencing significant immigration flows. Unravelling the factors that influence 
these Irish migration flows, a model was created to estimate next year net migration. In 
coherence with existing literature, it was found that GDP, unemployment, and inflation (in form 
of a crisis indicator) were significant predictors of migration. Furthermore, government 
spending was found to have a considerable impact on migration, revealing a new discovery of 
its influence on population movements. Moreover, this paper shows that unforeseen events, 
such as international conflicts, are challenging to account for and should be researched more 
in-depth. Knowing future migration levels is beneficial to both government institutions, who 
could use this data adjust migration policies, as well as businesses, who could adjust wages. 
Therefore, in addition to the research in this paper, an accessible product was created in form 
of a website through which it is possible to predict net migration based on certain input values.
